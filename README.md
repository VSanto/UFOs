## UFOs

## Create a Dynamic Webpage
The purpose of this project was to use Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and Chrome Dev tools to develope an interactive webpage for UFO sightings.
I began this project by using Javascript to build a table to hold the table data.  Then I added interactive filters, where users can enter information and the page will visually change when the results are displayed.  Finally, I created an HTML page that used the JavaScript and the CSS style files to visually create the webpage.  I then used Chrome Dev tools to work out any kinks in the code.  I had a help from my tutor Sharon.  She is amazing.  

## Results:
I was successful in creating the Dynamic Webpage.

I included an eye catching title.  I added a picture and article about UFOs from Nasa website.  Finally, I added the data table and the interactive filters.  When a user visits the webpage they are able to chose the type of filter they want to return the desired result. 
 
## Summary:
In summary, this was a fun project.  It helped me understand how the different programs work together to create the end result.  This project was packed with obstacles to get around.  I had a number of wrong bracket types, spelling mistakes, missing closing of div and ul.  I had underscores where dashes needed to be.  I received help at the end of the project from my tutor Sharon, who was able to guide me on getting the filters to be interactive.

## Recommendations:
I do feel that more could be done with the interactive portion of the webpage.  
I recommend adding a drop down menu for the different search options. When you go to the webpage the data is listed. You need to scroll down to get an idea of specific search options that will return results.  The user may be exploring UFO sighting information and may not know what specific information will populate results.  By adding a drop down menu of the data for that filter, the user will be able to click to view the results. 
I recommend having more articles about UFOs from the Nasa website.  Maybe make the articles filterable. Have the picture change depending on the article.
This will make the webpage easy to navigate for the less informed UFO enthusiast.
